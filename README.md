# About

This is a final project for CS 6375.002 (Machine Learning) at University of Texas at Dallas.

It was completed by Andy Hudson and Umar Khalid on 11/19/2020.

It demonstrates a Reinforcement Learner that can learn to navigate mazes only by the trail it's taken so far (not knowing any walls).

It uses a neural net to evaluate the utility function of a maze position. This neural net is trained through Q-learning.

# Running

The project requires pyGame.

Run main.py with python 3.
